<p align="justify">
A web worker is a JavaScript process that runs in the background of a webpage, without affecting the performance of the page. You can use most standard JavaScript features inside a web worker, but you canâ€™t directly affect the parent page.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Inline web workers are web workers that are created in the same web page context or on the fly, without requiring a separate JavaScript file. Blobs and object URLs are used under the hood to create inline web workers from functions or strings. Web workers allow you to perform true multi-threading and concurrency in your web applications.

<p align="justify">
<b>nygma-web-workers</b> is a powerful Javascript library that helps you interact seamlessly with web workers. The way you work with web workers is reminiscent of the use of thread objects in modern OOP languages such as C# or Java. Below is a code example of task definition which will be executed by web worker. As you can see it is a common function defined in global scope, which takes a WorkerArgs structure as a parameter. This structure contains an input object which can be of any cloneable object type and helper functions that allow task to communicate with the outside world. This code checks if the given number is prime or not.
</p>

```typescript
export interface WorkerArgs {
  data: any;
  done: Function;
  cancelled: Function;
  progress: Function;
  next: Function;
  error: Function;
}

export function task({data, progress, cancelled, done}: WorkerArgs) {
  progress(0);
  let value = 0;
  for (var i = 2, len = data / 2 + 1; i < len; i++) {
    if(i / len - value > 0.01) {
      value = i / len;
      progress(value);

      if(cancelled()) {
        return;
      }
    }
    if (data % i === 0) {
      progress(1);
      done(false);
      return;
    }
  }
  progress(1);
  done(true);
}
```
<p align="justify">
Another example of library use is an async function call. Code below shows the possible definition of timer routine. As you may noticed, this is not the case of progress notification, instead we use next method to inform the main thread about current status of a timer. Task cancellation is an option. Async function support will be probably added in further versions, currently it deeply depends on results of transpilation by typescript compiler.
</p>

```typescript
export function timer({data, done, next, cancelled}: WorkerArgs) {
  next('timer set to ' + data + 'ms');

  let interval = setInterval(() => {
    data -= 1000;
    next('elapsed ' + data + 'ms');

    if(data <= 0) {
      clearInterval(interval);
      next('timer completed');
      done();
    }
    if(cancelled()) {
      clearInterval(interval);
      next('timer cancelled');
    }
  }, 1000);
}
```

Next is an example of instantiation of inline worker. To start task execution we have to call run method of the worker. This method returns a promise object. Of course you can create multiple workers and run them in parallel. In this case you have to use Promise.all to wait for multiple asynchronous tasks to complete before doing something else.
</p>

```typescript
let worker: InlineWorker = new InlineWorker(task);

let promise = this.worker.progress((value) => console.log(value)).run(1234567890);
await Promise.all([worker])
```
<p align="justify">
The worker itself contains additionally some auxiliary methods that can brighten up your working routines. For instance, you can inject needed global functions into worker. Be aware, that this functionality is a bit sensitive to the method placement. So the methods from other files are decorated by webpack and that's why they cannot be used within worker. If you do not like the idea of cancellable workers or you have troubles with SharedBufferArray creation you can use terminate method which will silently kill the worker. To observe the progress of the execution, the callback function have to be passed as a parameter to progress method.

I would like to think that this library will make it easier to write concurrent code, which is still considered a gimmick for the browser.

Stay tuned, and keep having fun with programming! Lines of code, like chapters in a book, come together to tell a story of your digital adventures.
